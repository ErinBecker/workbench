## Glossary


[workbench]{#workbench .anchored}
: the collection of three packages used to build Carpentries lessons. NOTE: this
  is no longer called the “template”. 

[[{sandpaper}](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper)]{#sandpaper .anchored}
: the package that lesson contributors interact with. This orchestrates the
  building of lessons from markdown/rmarkdown to html

[[{pegboard}](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard)]{#pegboard .anchored}
: the validator for our lesson content.

[[{varnish}](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish)]{#varnish .anchored}
: html, css, and javascript styling for our lessons.

[[carpentries/actions](https://github.com/carpentries/actions)]{#actions .anchored}
: Automation for deploying and updating our lessons on GitHub

[Markdown Lesson Template]{#markdown-lesson-template .anchored}
: (https://bit.ly/new-lesson-md) a GitHub repository template to create a new
  lesson written in markdown using The Workbench

[R Markdown Lesson Template]{#r-markdown-lesson-template .anchored}
: (https://bit.ly/new-lesson-rmd) a GitHub repository template to create a new
  lesson written in R Markdown using The Workbench

[Official Lessons]{#official-lessons .anchored}
: Lessons within our Official Curriculum that are offered in
  Centrally-Organised or Self-Organised workshops. Community Lessons Lessons
  that are developed by community members, but are not offered in
  centrally-organised workshops

[Toolchain]{#toolchain  .anchored}
: A series of software tools that work together to accomplish a specific task.
  E.g. The Carpentries Workbench is a toolchain built with R and pandoc to
  publish accessible lesson websites from markdown or R Markdown content.

[Styles (aka lesson template)]{#styles .anchored}
: This is the lesson infrastructure established in 2016 and can be found at
  https://github.com/carpentries/styles. It uses Jekyll for rendering markdown
  to HTML with a Make-based workflow. The Carpentries Workbench supersedes this
  infrastructure. This particular infrastructure required that the tools and
  templates were embedded within the lesson itself, meaning that updates were
  often cumbersome. 

[Lesson infrastructure]{#lesson-infrastructure .anchored}
: The collection tools and templates required to build Carpentries-style lessons. 

[Lesson-transition tool]{#lesson-transition-tool .anchored}
: A custom toolchain that prepared existing lessons to use The Carpentries
  Workbench: https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-transition. This would
  transform markdown syntax from Kramdown to Pandoc-flavoured markdown and it
  would remove commits unrelated to the lesson content.

[Jekyll]{#jekyll .anchored}
: A static site generator that is used by default to build websites on GitHub
  from markdown. 

[Kramdown]{#kramdown .anchored}
: The default flavour of markdown used by
  [Jekyll](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html). It is originally based
  off of a PHP variant of the original markdown syntax that is not widely used. 

[Pandoc-flavoured markdown]{#pandoc-flavoured-markdown .anchored}
: A style of markdown that is derived from CommonMark and is the basis for the
  pandoc document converter <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown>.

[Fishtree Attempt (https://github.com/fishtree-attempt) ]{#fishtree-attempt .anchored}
: GitHub organisation to host testing repositories of the transformed lessons. 

[Beta Phase (https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html) ]{#beta-phase .anchored}
: This is the phase in which lessons are tested with maintainers, instructors,
  and learners to evaluate any potential snags in the websites that should be
  fixed before converting all of our lessons. This is divided into three stages
  for each lesson.

[Pre-beta stage (8 weeks)]{#pre-beta-stage .anchored}
:  (https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html#pre-beta) a snapshot
  of a lesson is converted to the workbench in a separate github organisation
  and hosted on a temporary url (preview.carpentries.org/<lesson>). A banner is
  hosted on the github URL indicating a beta test with a link to the new url. 

[Beta stage (8 weeks)]{#beta-stage .anchored}
:  (https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html#beta) a lesson
  release and archive is created. The lesson is converted to the workbench and
  hosted on (preview.carpentries.org/<lesson>). The github URL hosts the
  snapshot of the lesson at the given release and has a link to the new URL,
  indicating that it is the up-to-date version.

[Release Candidate (24 weeks)]{#release-candidate .anchored}
:  (https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html#pre-release) The
  default URL will now show the Workbench version of the lesson and the styles
  version of the lesson will be archived. During this time, any imperfections
  in the transition are to be addressed by the maintainers.
