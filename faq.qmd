## Work In Progress

As this is a FAQ, it will continue to grow as we update it. If you have any
questions please submit them to the [Workbench GitHub
discussion forum](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions).

I will attempt to divide these questions up by major categories, but these may
shift around as questions come in.

If you have a question about definitions, consult our [glossary](glossary.html)

## Authoring

These FAQs are intended for those who contribute to, maintain, or create lessons
using The Workbench. If you only ever visit the website, then head over to 
the [Teaching](#teaching) or [Learning](#learning) sections.

### Local Clones


[How do I update my clone after the transition from styles?]{#update-clone-from-styles .anchored}
: The easiest way is to rename your local clone to `old-NAME` (where `NAME` is
  the name of your repository folder) and then re-clone the lesson. You can 
  find details on [updating your local clone](beta-phase.html#updating-clone) on
  the beta phase page.

### GitHub Forks

[How do I update my fork after the transition from styles?]{#update-fork-from-styles .anchored}
: The easiest way to do this is to delete your fork and re-clone. The commit
  history of the lesson has changed and you will be unable to commit until your
  fork reflects those changes. Note that if you have a clone, you will need to
  also [delete and re-clone](#update-clone-from-styles).
