## Work In Progress

As this is a FAQ, it will continue to grow as we update it. If you have any
questions please submit them to the [Workbench GitHub
discussion forum](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions).

I will attempt to divide these questions up by major categories, but these may
shift around as questions come in.

If you have a question about definitions, consult our [glossary](glossary.html)

## Authoring

These FAQs are intended for those who contribute to, maintain, or create lessons
using The Workbench. If you only ever visit the website, then head over to 
the [Teaching](#teaching) or [Learning](#learning) sections.

### Local Clones


#### How do I update my clone after the transition from styles? {#update-clone-from-styles}

The easiest way is to rename your local clone to `old-NAME` (where `NAME` is the
name of your repository folder) and then re-clone the lesson. You can find
details on [updating your local clone](beta-phase.html#updating-clone) on the
beta phase page.

### GitHub Forks

#### How do I create a fork for teaching? 

A common pattern for teaching is to create a fork of a lesson, modify it to add
or remove specific section. Because the pages on The Workbench are deployed by
GitHub actions, there are a couple of extra steps you need to do to enable the 
pages to load after the transition.

In short, when you fork, to make it easier, you should bring in all branches, 
enable GitHub pages, and enable GitHub Actions. After that, you will have your
lesson website and can teach from it.

You can find the instructions here: https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/01/dovetail-14/#tips-and-tricks-for-using-the-workbench

#### How do I update my fork after the transition from styles? {#update-fork-from-styles}

**This is only applicable if you have created a fork of the lesson before
2023-02-06.**

##### Do not "synchronise" your fork

If you attempt to synchronise your fork from the GitHub interface and create a
pull request, that pull request will fail. Instead, follow the instructions
below.

:::

The easiest way to do this is to delete your fork and re-clone. The commit
history of the lesson has changed and you will be unable to commit until your
fork reflects those changes (this is known as the [burn it all down
strategy](https://happygitwithr.com/burn.html)): 

1. Save your edits on locally or in a scratch space.
2. **[Delete your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)** 
3. **[Create a new fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)** or use the "edit" button on the page you wish to edit.
4. Apply your changes (**NOTE The Workbench uses a different syntax.** Here is
   a [Transition Guide from Styles to
   Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/transition-guide.html)
   for your reference). 

Note that if you have a clone, you will need to also [delete and re-clone](#update-clone-from-styles).

##### Production Forks

If you have a fork of a lesson that you have modified significantly and wish to
continue maintaining under The Workbench, contact Zhian Kamvar and he will help
you transition your repository.

::: {.callout-warning}

##### contributing without deleting

If you contribute directly on the lesson itself using the "edit" button on
GitHub, a new branch will be created for you and you can edit on that branch
without deleting your fork. 

This method is _not recommended_ because it runs the risk that you will
accidentally merge histories in your fork.
