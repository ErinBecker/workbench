## Introduction

The Carpentries Workbench is the set of R packages and other tools that make it
easy for anyone to create and contribute to a Carpentries Lesson and it was
designed with the following guiding principles:

1. **Lesson contributors do not need to know anything about the toolchain to
   contribute in a meaningful way**,
2. Elements of the toolchain that evaluates, validates, and stylizes should
   live in **separate repositories to allow for seamless updating**, and 
3. The procedures should be **well-documented and generalizable** enough that the
   toolchain is not entirely dependent on R.

This document provides details of how the packages of the workbench work
behind the scenes to create a full Carpentries lesson website from markdown
source file. 

### Tools

The Workbench is built on top of the following major pieces of software, all of
which are available via [RStudio](https://rstudio.com)

 - **Git **
 - **R**
 - **[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org)**

The workbench itself consists of three R packages, which can all be updated on
the fly with no changes to the lesson.

There are three packages that comprise The Workbench:

- [{sandpaper}](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/): User interface and engine for the workbench
- [{pegboard}](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard/): Validation and parsing of lesson components
- [{varnish}](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates

In addition, The workbench uses the following packages for support:

- [{knitr}](https://yihui.org/knitr/): engine that renders R Markdown documents to Markdown
- [{tinkr}](https://docs.ropensci.org/tinkr/): converts Markdown to an XML representation for {pegboard} to parse
- [{pkgdown}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/): provisioning and applying HTML templates
- [{gert}](https://gert.r-lib.org/): interface to git with or without a local installation.

## Local Workflow


### The two-step

The local workflow is known as a 'two-step' workflow, which renders markdown
from the source files (either Markdown or R Markdown) and then applies the 
styling to HTML rendered from these Markdown sources. 

![The local two-step model of deployment into local
folders](fig/local-flow.svg){alt='diagram of three folders. The first
folder, "episodes/", labelled as RMarkdown, has an arrow (labelled as hash
episodes) pointing to "site/built/", labelled as Markdown. The Markdown folder
has an arrow (labelled as "apply template") pointing to "site/docs/", labelled
as "HTML". The first folder is labelled in pale yellow, indicating that it is
the only one tracked by git.'}

::: {.callout-note}
Only the source files here are tracked by Git. Everything else is ignored locally.
:::

We use the two-step process because it provides us an air-gap between the tools
needed to build the markdown and the tools needed to render the website. It also
provides us a ready cache of outputs so that R Markdown source content does not
need to be re-rendered. Moreover, we designed these tools to be independent from
each other so that if, in the future, we can mix and match with different tools
as they become available.

::: {.callout-note}
The two-step process is not new; the [{rmarkdown}](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/)
package uses this process behind the scenes, but it will discard the markdown
output by default.

### Validation

Lesson validation is performed by {pegboard} by parsing Markdown and evaluating
the elements for low-hanging fruit of accessibility: 

 1. [Link and Image Validity](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard/articles/validation.html#link-validation)
 2. [Fenced Div Validity](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard/articles/validation.html#fenced-div-validation)
 3. [Heading Validity](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard/articles/validation.html#heading-validation)

**The validation of lesson elements is performed _before_ the lesson is
built**, so that the contributor can address any issues even if they have a
broken component in the rest of the toolchain. Invalid lesson elements are
displayed on the contributors R console with information about the location of
the error, an explanation of what was wrong, and a link to resources to help
explain the error and offer correction.

### In Practice

Because of the need for bootstrapping, validation, and caching, the number of 
steps from source files to lesson website is considerably more than two. The
diagram below describes shows the process by which a lesson is built using the
workbench.

1. The lesson contributor has an idea and writes it in Markdown or R Markdown
2. The lesson contributor runs `sandpaper::serve()` to start the engine.
3. {sandpaper} passes this file to {pegboard}, which checks it for accessibility
   and reports to the user if there are any errors
4. {sandpaper} passes the file to {knitr}, which renders the file to Markdown
   and stores it in the `site/built` folder
5. {sandpaper} passes the file to PANDOC, which renders the Markdown to HTML
   (this is temporarily stored as a character vector in R)
6. {sandpaper} passes the HTML to {pkgdown}, which applies the templates from 
   {varnish}, creating the lesson website.
