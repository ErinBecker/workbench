## Introduction


This section of the website is dedicated to materials you may need when you want
to make a contribution to The Carpentries Workbench. It will detail the minimum
developer environment required to contribute to the components of this project. 

::: {.callout-warning}

### This section is still under construction!

We are still assembling the documentation for this part of the site. If you
would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue.

:::

The core of The Carpentries Workbench consists of three packages: 

 - [{sandpaper}]\: user interface and workflow engine
 - [{pegboard}]\: parsing and validation engine
 - [{varnish}]\: HTML templates, CSS, and JS elements

These packages are all available and released to the [Carpentries 
R-Universe][r-universe], which checks for updates to the source packages hourly. 

If you are interested, we have [documentation for the release process](releases.html) 
available.

## Development

Development of The Workbench is overseen by Zhian N. Kamvar. New features are
added incrementally as pull requests. Pushes to the main branch are _rare_ and
discouraged. New features must have tests associated (with the exception of
{varnish}).

### Software Tools

Development of Workbench components requires the same toolchain for working on
lessons:

 - R
 - pandoc
 - Git


```{bash}
R --version
pandoc --version
git --version
```


Once you have these installed, make sure to install ALL of the dependencies for
the workbench:

```{.r}
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "pegboard", "varnish", "tinkr"),
  dependencies = TRUE,
  repos = c(getOption("repos"), "https://carpentries.r-universe.dev"))
```


In addition, you will need the [{devtools}](https://devtools.r-lib.org) for
development.

```{.r}
install.packages("devtools")
```

### Documentation

Reference documentation for individual functions for each package is written
alongside the function using [{roxygen2}](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/).

This documentation is generated by `devtools::document()`

### Testing

Tests for each package live in `tests/testthat/` and follow a
`test-[file-name].R` naming convention. These are controlled by the
[{testthat}](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) package and run by `devtools::test()`.

Note that {sandpaper} tests take a long time to run and _require_ internet. 

### Continous Integration

The continous integration for each package tests on Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows
systems with the last five versions of R (same as the RStudio convention).
