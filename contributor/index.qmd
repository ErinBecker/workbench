to make a contribution to The Carpentries Workbench. It will detail the minimum

### This section is still under construction!

We are still assembling the documentation for this part of the site. If you
would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue.

:::

The core of The Carpentries Workbench consists of three packages: 

 - [{sandpaper}]\: user interface and workflow engine
 - [{pegboard}]\: parsing and validation engine
 - [{varnish}]\: HTML templates, CSS, and JS elements

These packages are all available and released to the [Carpentries 
R-Universe][r-universe], which checks for updates to the source packages hourly. 

If you are interested, we have [documentation for the release process](releases.html) 
available.
