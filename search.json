Everything else is ignored locally.\n\n\nWe use the two-step process because it provides us an air-gap between the tools needed to build the markdown and the tools needed to render the website. It also provides us a ready cache of outputs so that R Markdown source content does not need to be re-rendered. Moreover, we designed these tools to be independent from each other so that if, in the future, we can mix and match with different tools as they become available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe two-step process is not new; the {rmarkdown} package uses this process behind the scenes, but it will discard the markdown output by default.\n\n\n\n\nValidation\nLesson validation is performed by {pegboard} by parsing Markdown and evaluating the elements for low-hanging fruit of accessibility:\n\nLink and Image Validity\nFenced Div Validity\nHeading Validity\n\nThe validation of lesson elements is performed before the lesson is built, so that the contributor can address any issues even if they have a broken component in the rest of the toolchain. Invalid lesson elements are displayed on the contributors R console with information about the location of the error, an explanation of what was wrong, and a link to resources to help explain the error and offer correction.\n\n\nIn Practice\nBecause of the need for bootstrapping, validation, and caching, the number of steps from source files to lesson website is considerably more than two. The diagram below describes shows the process by which a lesson is built using the workbench.\n\nThe lesson contributor has an idea and writes it in Markdown or R Markdown\nThe lesson contributor runs sandpaper::serve() to start the engine.\n{sandpaper} passes this file to {pegboard}, which checks it for accessibility and reports to the user if there are any errors\n{sandpaper} passes the file to {knitr}, which renders the file to Markdown and stores it in the site/built folder\n{sandpaper} passes the file to PANDOC, which renders the Markdown to HTML (this is temporarily stored as a character vector in R)\n{sandpaper} passes the HTML to {pkgdown}, which applies the templates from {varnish}, creating the lesson website."

It is now at the stage where we are confident that it is in a stable condition to be used for Carpentries Lessons as a whole. Of course, with over 100 maintainers and even more instructors, making a sudden change has the potential to be massively disruptive.\nInstead, we are slowly releasing The Workbench in three stages over a 16 week period during which there will be parallel websites showing two versions of the same lesson1. For example, when you visit https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson, there will be a banner at the top of every page that will give a link to the beta version of the lesson (under https://preview.carpentries.org/) and the dates the styles version will be deprecated and finally superseded.\n\n\nThis slow progression is designed to allow community members to familiarlize themselves with the new format and to build expertise within the community for May 2023 when the infrastructure is formally released.\nThe three stages are called “pre-beta”, “beta”2, and “pre-release”.\n\n\n\nAn overview of the Workbench beta phase for the Git repository and the website, separated into three stages. The entire process will take about 12 months until the pre-beta stage.\n\n\n\npre-beta (two repos, two sites)\nLessons in this stage will have a workbench version of the lesson live in a separate repository in a sandbox GitHub organisation3. This version will be a snapshot from the date of the pre-beta version. Any changes made to the snapshot will appear on the beta website, but will disappear as soon as the lesson enters beta. Maintainers are encouraged to clone this snapshot repository and try it out by creating pull requests that change content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasks to try\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the pre-beta stage is to make sure maintainers are comfortable with working on the lesson. Anything that happens on the sandbox repository is not permanent. Below is a list of tasks for different members of the community to try.\nAs always, please provide feedback in our < 1 minute survey\n\nMaintainersInstructorsContributors\n\n\nDuring this time, you should take the time to merge or resolve any open PRs in your lesson. And yes, this is a big task and it is helpful to remember how to say ‘no’ in a way that respects the contributor’s time and effort.

If you feel like you need help with a particular PR, please contact Zhian and he will help craft a response.\nDuring this stage, you are working on the lesson as you would normally, which means to address any issues or pull requests that come in and improve the lesson. In addition, I would recommend to continue to do the things you were doing during the pre-beta stage, but first:\n\nUpdate your local version of the lesson (instructions to update)\n\n\n\nBrowse the lesson and give feedback on your impressions. Is everything where you expect it to be?\nNow that the lesson source is in a permanent stage, add an inline instructor note.

Details can be found in The Lesson Transition repository:\n\nQuck and Dirtyvia Git: Markdown Lessonsvia Git: R Markdown Lessons\n\n\nThe easiest way is to get the updates and avoid dreaded merges is to use the burn it all down approach. For those who are more confident in their git skills, read on.\n\n\nThe general strategy is the same as when someone changes the name of their default branch: rename your local branch, fetch the changes, and set the right branch to track upstream:\nIn your lesson, use these commands. DO NOT PULL FIRST.\ngit checkout gh-pages              # make sure you are gh-pages\ngit branch -m gh-pages legacy/gh-pages               # rename the gh-pages branch to legacy\ngit fetch origin                                     # fetch changes from GitHub\ngit branch -u origin/legacy/gh-pages legacy/gh-pages # make sure your legacy branch tracks\ngit checkout main                  # switch to the brand-new main branch\ngit remote set-head origin -a      # set main branch to be your local default\n\n\nThe general strategy is the same as when someone changes the name of their default branch: rename your local branch, fetch the changes, and set the right branch to track upstream:\nIn your lesson, use these commands.

Title (optional) sandpaper 3.3.3\n# ? Release notes  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]\n#   Write my own\n# > Write using generated notes as template\n#   Leave blank\nSelecting “Write using generated notes as a template” opens an editor and populates it with the pull requests that have been accepted since the last release.\nOnce the relase is created on GitHub, then the package will be available on the R-Universe in about an hour or less."
