## What is the Workbench Beta Phase?

The Carpentries Workbench, first released in January 2022, has been running
without issue for several months with several early adopters, who have all
contributed to its improvement from their feedback. It is now at the stage
where we are confident that it is in a stable condition to be used for
Carpentries Lessons as a whole. Of course, with over 100 maintainers and even
more instructors, making a sudden change has the potential to be massively
disruptive.

Instead, we are slowly releasing The Workbench in **three stages _per lesson_**
over a **12 week period during which there will be _parallel websites_ showing
two versions of the same lesson[^parallel-nightmares].** For example, when you
visit `https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson`, there will be a banner at
the top of every page that will give a link to the beta version of the lesson
(under `https://preview.carpentries.org/`) and the dates the styles version
will be deprecated and finally superseded.

This slow progression is designed to allow community members to familiarlize
themselves with the new format and to build expertise within the community for
April 2022 when the infrastructure is formally released.

The three stages are called "pre-beta", "beta"[^beta], and "pre-release".

[^parallel-nightmares]: It will be mostly the same content, save for small
  changes as described in the different stages.
[^beta]: Note, this is NOT the same thing as an in-development lesson being in
  Beta.

months until the pre-beta stage.

labelled 'current' that contains a GitHub logo, a cartoon of a lesson page.
Below is a box labelled 'Pre Beta' with the same contents as the box above plus
an additional GitHub logo in blue with a camera above it (to indicate a
snapshot) and a new cartoon of a lesson page with a padlock over it. There is a
clock indicating a timeframe of four weeks. The next box below is labelled
'Beta'. The GitHub logo has become blue and there is a lightning bolt and a
line connecting it to the previous logo, indicating that a transformation
happened. A smaller, grey GitHub logo is adjacent with a lock over it,
indicating that it is archived. The  old lesson page now has a lock and
information symbol above it. The new lesson page does not have any symbols
above it. The timreframe is 6 to 8 weeks. The final box is titled 'Release
Candidate' and has a single blue GitHub logo, a faded old lesson page, and a
new lesson page with a timeframe of 6 months"}

### **pre-beta** (two repos, two sites) {#pre-beta}

Lessons in this stage will have a workbench version of the lesson live in a
separate repository in a sandbox GitHub organisation. This version will be a
**snapshot from the date of the pre-beta version**. Any changes made to the
snapshot will appear on the beta website, but will disappear as soon as the
lesson enters beta. Maintainers are encouraged to clone this snapshot
repository and try it out by creating pull requests that change content. 

### **beta** (one repo using the workbench, two sites) {#beta}

Lessons in this stage will undergo a lesson release of the styles version and a
snapshot of the repository, including issues and pull requests, will be archived. 
The branch serving the github pages will be frozen and renamed to "legacy" and
will continue to serve to GitHub Pages.

The workbench version of the repository will be inserted as the "main" branch
with a modified history to remove all commits from styles and generated
content[^modify]. **All new changes to the lesson will be made to the workbench
version.**

#### Updating your local clone

During this phase, you will need to take care to bring in the changes to your
local clone because they WILL be different. Details can be found in [The Lesson
Transition repository](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-transition#keeping-your-clone-up-to-date):

::: {.panel-tabset}

##### Quck and Dirty

The easiest way is to get the updates and avoid dreaded merges is to use the
[burn it all down approach](https://happygitwithr.com/burn.html). For those who
are more confident in their git skills, read on.


##### via Git: Markdown Lessons

The general strategy is the same as when someone changes the name of their
default branch: rename your local branch, fetch the changes, and set the right
branch to track upstream:

In your lesson, use these commands. DO NOT PULL FIRST.

```bash
git checkout gh-pages              # make sure you are gh-pages
git branch -m gh-pages legacy      # rename the gh-pages branch to legacy
git fetch origin                   # fetch changes from GitHub
git branch -u origin/legacy legacy # make sure your legacy branch tracks
git checkout main                  # switch to the brand-new main branch
git remote set-head origin -a      # set main branch to be your local default
```

##### via Git: R Markdown Lessons

The general strategy is the same as when someone changes the name of their
default branch: rename your local branch, fetch the changes, and set the right
branch to track upstream:

In your lesson, use these commands. DO NOT PULL FIRST.

```bash
git checkout main                  # make sure you are on main
git branch -m main old             # change 'main' to a local 'old' branch
git checkout gh-pages              # switch to gh-pages
git branch -m gh-pages legacy      # rename the gh-pages branch to legacy
git fetch origin                   # fetch changes from GitHub
git branch -u origin/legacy legacy # make sure your legacy branch tracks
git checkout main                  # switch to the brand-new main branch
git remote set-head origin -a      # set main branch to be your local default
```

[^modify]: For details of what will happen to the files and syntax during the
  transition, see [The Transition Guide](transition-guide.html). During the 
  transformation, we will also excise the commits from styles, which necessarily
  rerwite the history of the lesson, while **preserving the commits from lesson
  content**. This move has two benefits: 
  1. The list of committers on the lesson will better reflect the actual lesson
  contributors rather than the contributors to the template.
  2. Lessons will be reduced in size so that downloading them and contributing to
  them will be easier. There _is_ precedence for this: When Software Carpentry
  moved its lessons from the original
  [swcarpentr/bc](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc) monorepo, they excised the
  commits related to each lesson from the repository, but preserved the history.

Maintainers will continue to work on this workbench version of the lesson.

### **pre-release (release-candidate)** (one repo using workbench, one site) {#pre-release}

The styles version of the lesson (in the `legacy` branch) will be removed,
the default version of the lesson will switch to The Workbench, and the 
workbench-beta website will redirect to the live lesson.

### Official Lessons

These are the official Carpentries lessons that will enter the Beta Phase during
2022-Q4 and 2023-Q1. The dates in the columns reflect the anticipated dates for
the transitions of the different stages of the Beta Phase. Note that any stage
that overlaps the last week of December and the first week of January will be
extended by two weeks due to Winter holidays.
